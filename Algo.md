## Encoding
1. Take the user's ETH address, BTC address, and Gmail account as input.
2. Generate a random salt value.
3. Concatenate the ETH address, BTC address, Gmail account, and salt into a single string.
4. Hash the concatenated string using a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256) to create a unique identifier.
5. Generate a random private key and derive the corresponding public key.
6. Encrypt the unique identifier using a symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g., AES) with a generated encryption key.
7. Encrypt the encryption key using the user's public key.
8. Embed the encrypted identifier and encrypted encryption key into the Cosmos address using the existing encoding process.

## Decoding and Ownership Recovery
1. Extract the encrypted identifier and encrypted encryption key from the Cosmos address using the existing decoding process.
2. Provide options for the user to prove ownership of their ETH address, BTC address, or Gmail account:
   - For ETH or BTC address: Request the user to sign a specific message using their private key associated with the respective address. Verify the signature using the corresponding public key.
   - For Gmail account: Implement an OAuth flow or send a verification code to the user's Gmail address. Request the user to provide the verification code to prove ownership.
3. If the user successfully proves ownership of any one of the associated identities (ETH address, BTC address, or Gmail account):
   - Retrieve the encrypted encryption key from the Cosmos address.
   - Decrypt the encryption key using the private key associated with the proven identity (e.g., ETH private key, BTC private key, or Gmail account access token).
   - Use the decrypted encryption key to decrypt the encrypted identifier.
   - Verify that the decrypted identifier matches the unique identifier generated during the encoding process (by concatenating the proven identity, other identities, and salt).
   - If the verification succeeds, consider the user as the legitimate owner of the Cosmos address and grant access to the associated user information.

In this approach, the initial private key is not required for decoding and ownership recovery. Instead, the user can prove ownership using their ETH address, BTC address, or Gmail account. The encryption key used to encrypt the identifier is itself encrypted using the user's public key and embedded into the Cosmos address.

During the ownership recovery process, if the user proves ownership of one of the associated identities, they can decrypt the encryption key using their corresponding private key (ETH private key, BTC private key, or Gmail account access token). With the decrypted encryption key, they can then decrypt the identifier and verify it against the provided identities and salt.

This way, even if the initial private key is lost, the user can still regain access to their Cosmos address and associated user information by proving ownership through alternative methods.

Implementing this approach would require modifications to the existing code, including:
- Encrypting the identifier using a symmetric encryption algorithm with a generated encryption key.
- Encrypting the encryption key using the user's public key.
- Embedding both the encrypted identifier and encrypted encryption key into the Cosmos address.
- Modifying the decoding and ownership recovery process to handle the encrypted encryption key and the different ownership verification methods.

Again, note that integrating with ETH, BTC, and Gmail for ownership verification will require additional libraries, APIs, or OAuth flows specific to each platform.
